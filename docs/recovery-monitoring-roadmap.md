## Implementation Priority

For maximizing value with injury prediction (#30), implement in this order:

1. ✅ **#54** - Data collection infrastructure (DONE)
2. **#110** - Data quality service (6 weeks)
   - Essential for reliable ML models
   - Validates data before analysis
   - Reduces noise in training data
3. **#111** - Advanced analytics (10 weeks)
   - Provides predictive features for injury model
   - Establishes pattern recognition
   - Creates early warning foundation
4. **#55** - Recovery analysis (can run in parallel with #111)
   - Uses insights from #111
   - Provides user-facing features
5. **#30** - Injury prediction (15+ weeks)
   - Leverages all previous work
   - Uses validated, high-quality data
   - Benefits from predictive analytics foundation

## Wearable Integration (Optional for ML)

Phases 2-4 from original #54 (Oura, Whoop, Apple Health) can be implemented:
- **In parallel** with data quality and analytics work
- **After** if focusing on ML first (manual data is sufficient for initial models)

These provide:
- Automated data collection
- Higher data quality (device-based)
- Better user experience
- More complete datasets

But are NOT required for ML model development - manual entry provides sufficient data.

## Timeline Summary

- **Completed**: Phase 1 (Data Collection) - 6 weeks
- **Next 6 weeks**: Phase 4 (Data Quality) - Issue #110
- **Weeks 7-16**: Phase 6 (Advanced Analytics) - Issue #111  
- **Weeks 7-12** (parallel): Phase 3 (Recovery Analysis) - Issue #55
- **Weeks 17-31**: Injury Prediction - Issues #30, #48-#53

**Total to Advanced ML-Ready System**: ~16 weeks from now
**Total to Full Injury Prediction**: ~31 weeks from now

## Key Takeaways

1. **Data Quality First**: #110 is critical foundation for all ML work
2. **Predictive Analytics**: #111 provides features for injury prediction
3. **Wearables Optional**: Manual data sufficient for initial ML models
4. **Parallel Paths**: Recovery analysis and advanced analytics can overlap
5. **ML-Ready**: After #110 + #111, full injury prediction ML can begin

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve Issue #110 (Data Quality)
2. Review and approve Issue #111 (Advanced Analytics)
3. Prioritize: Data Quality (#110) before Advanced Analytics (#111)
4. Consider: Recovery Analysis (#55) in parallel with #111
5. Plan: Injury Prediction (#30) after foundation is complete
