# Training Plan Integration with Recovery Scores

## Overview

Automatic training adjustment system that optimizes workout intensity and volume based on daily recovery scores. Prevents overtraining and maximizes training effectiveness by scheduling hard workouts on high-readiness days.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Phase 5 Complete - MVP

**Core Features Implemented:**
1. âœ… Training Adjustment Service - TSS calculations and workout modifications
2. âœ… User Settings & Consent - Customizable adjustment preferences
3. âœ… Real-time Adjustment API - Daily training recommendations
4. âœ… Effectiveness Tracking - Decision logging and outcome measurement

## Architecture

### Components

1. **TrainingAdjustmentService** (`src/services/training_adjustment_service.rs`)
   - TSS adjustment calculations based on readiness scores
   - Workout modification suggestions (intensity/volume reduction)
   - Rest day decision logic with multi-factor analysis

2. **Training Recovery Settings** (`training_recovery_settings` table)
   - User preferences for auto-adjustment
   - Aggressiveness levels (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
   - Min rest days and max consecutive training days
   - Permission flags for different adjustment types

3. **Adjustment Tracking** (`training_adjustments` table)
   - Log adjustment recommendations and user decisions
   - Track actual TSS vs recommended
   - Measure outcomes (next-day recovery, training quality)

## Adjustment Logic

### TSS Adjustment Calculation

Based on readiness score:

| Readiness Score | Adjustment Factor | Recommendation |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| â‰¥ 80 | 1.1 (110%) | Can increase load 10% |
| 70-79 | 1.0 (100%) | Proceed as planned |
| 60-69 | 0.95 (95%) | Slight reduction (5%) |
| 50-59 | 0.85 (85%) | Moderate reduction (15%) |
| 40-49 | 0.7 (70%) | Significant reduction (30%) |
| 30-39 | 0.5 (50%) | Major reduction (50%) |
| < 30 | 0.3 (30%) | Rest or very light (70% reduction) |

### Rest Day Decision Logic

Rest day recommended when:
1. **Critical Recovery**: Readiness < 30
2. **Consecutive Poor Recovery**: Readiness < 40 AND 3+ consecutive poor days
3. **Extended Fatigue**: 7+ days without good recovery (readiness < 80)

**Confidence Scoring:**
- Readiness < 30: 95% confidence
- 3+ poor days: 85% confidence
- 7+ days without good recovery: 75% confidence

### Workout Modification Types

1. **rest_day** (Adjustment factor < 0.5)
   - Recommend complete rest or active recovery
   - Alternative: Light walk, yoga, stretching

2. **reduce_intensity** (Adjustment factor 0.5-0.8)
   - Reduce intensity factor by 20%
   - Slight duration reduction (10%)
   - Maintain workout type

3. **reduce_volume** (Adjustment factor 0.8-1.0)
   - Reduce duration proportionally
   - Maintain intensity
   - Same workout type

4. **no_change** (Adjustment factor â‰¥ 1.0)
   - Proceed with planned workout
   - May increase if readiness â‰¥ 80

## Aggressiveness Levels

### Conservative
- Prioritizes recovery over progression
- Applies adjustments at higher readiness thresholds
- Suggests rest earlier
- Best for: Injury-prone athletes, recovery phase

### Moderate (Default)
- Balanced approach
- Standard adjustment thresholds (as shown above)
- Best for: Most athletes, general training

### Aggressive
- Prioritizes training load
- Only adjusts at lower readiness scores
- Suggests rest only when critical
- Best for: Experienced athletes, peak training blocks

## User Experience Flow

### Daily Workflow

1. **Morning Check**
   - User wakes up, opens app
   - Recovery score calculated from overnight data
   - Dashboard shows today's readiness

2. **Adjustment Review**
   - Sees planned workout with adjustment recommendation
   - Reviews reasoning (HRV, sleep, RHR factors)
   - Views TSS: Original â†’ Recommended

3. **Decision Making**
   - User decides: Apply adjustment or keep original
   - One-click apply modifies workout
   - Can override and proceed as planned

4. **Post-Workout**
   - Logs actual workout completed
   - System tracks: Applied adjustment? Actual TSS?
   - Optional: Rate training quality

5. **Learning Loop**
   - Next day's recovery measured
   - System learns from outcomes
   - Improves future recommendations

## Settings Customization

```bash
PATCH /api/v1/training/adjustment/recovery-settings
{
  "allow_intensity_reduction": true,
  "allow_volume_reduction": true,
  "allow_workout_swap": false
}
```

## Effectiveness Tracking

### Metrics Collected

1. **Adjustment Adherence**: % of recommendations followed
2. **Recovery Improvement**: Next-day recovery when adjusted vs not
3. **Training Quality**: User-reported session quality
4. **Injury Prevention**: Correlation with injury incidents

### Analysis Queries

**Adherence Rate:**
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(CASE WHEN adjustment_applied THEN 1 END)::FLOAT / COUNT(*) * 100 as adherence_rate
FROM training_adjustments
WHERE user_id = $1;
```

**Recovery Improvement:**
```sql
SELECT
    AVG(CASE WHEN adjustment_applied THEN outcome_recovery_score END) as applied_recovery,
    AVG(CASE WHEN NOT adjustment_applied THEN outcome_recovery_score END) as ignored_recovery
FROM training_adjustments
WHERE user_id = $1 AND outcome_recovery_score IS NOT NULL;
```
